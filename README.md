# Air Quality

Monitor the air you breathe with the React Native Air Quality Monitor app. This application provides real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data for cities around the world, allowing users to stay informed about the air quality in their surroundings. The app utilizes an online API to fetch up-to-date AQI information and presents it on an interactive map. Users can easily identify air quality levels through color-coded pins on the map, making it a visually intuitive experience.

Features
Map Visualization: Explore air quality levels across different cities through an interactive map. Each city is represented by a pin on the map, color-coded to indicate the AQI level. This feature provides a quick overview of air quality conditions globally.

City Search: Get detailed information about the air quality in a specific city by using the search functionality. Users can enter the name of a city and receive real-time data, including AQI levels and details about specific pollutants affecting air quality.

Favorite Cities: Customize your experience by marking favorite cities. This feature allows for quick access to air quality details for the locations that matter most to you. Easily stay informed about the air quality in your preferred areas.
